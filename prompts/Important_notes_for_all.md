# Important Notes for All Prompts:

Each person should:

1. Start with a simple prototype (working by end of Day 1)
2. Write clean, modular code with clear interfaces for integration
3. Document design decisions (why you chose this approach)
4. Include test cases with sample data
5. Log extensively for debugging
6. Use type hints (Python 3.9+) for clarity
7. Create requirements.txt with pinned versions
